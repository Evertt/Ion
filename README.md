# Mos 
###### (mac operating system)

A lightweight (11kb minified, 13kb un-minified) CSS framework that brings MacOS styled elements to Electron.

### About

Mos was developed with the aim of bringing native MacOS elements and components, such as buttons, sidebars, search inputs, tables, icons, and toolbars, to HTML and CSS. 

Mos is designed to be used specifically within an [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) application, but can be used just fine in a normal HTMl page.
